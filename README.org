#+TITLE: yt-rss

A small Flask app which parses YouTube Atom feed via [[https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser][feedparser]] and generates a new one via [[https://github.com/lkiesow/python-feedgen][feedgen]].

The problem this app solves is that YouTube feeds feature some non-standard tags, which [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][elfeed]] (my RSS client of choice) can't recognize. So entries from a YouTube feed lack preview and description.

[[https://github.com/iv-org/invidious][Invidious]] feeds don't have such a problem, but public instances seem to be unstable, and hosting one takes some resources. Hence this program.

* Installation
Install the dependencies:
#+begin_src bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_src

Change a token in .env file:
#+begin_src conf-space
TOKEN=secret
#+end_src

Run for production via a server of your choice, I prefer gunicorn:
#+begin_src bash
gunicorn main:app
#+end_src

If you want to deploy the thing behind a reverse proxy, you'd have to do something like this (for nginx):
#+begin_src conf-space
location /yt-rss/ {
    rewrite /yt-rss/(.*) /$1 break;
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
}
#+end_src

* Usage
A feed for a channel will be available at
#+begin_src bash
http://localhost:8000/<channel_id>?token=<token>
#+end_src
